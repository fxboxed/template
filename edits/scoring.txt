1 correct tile = 2
1 present tile = 1
1 absent tile = 0
there shall be 10 toast, number 10(highest) to 1
after entering each row a toast will appear depending upon line total
the toast will be visible for 1.5s
I will add the different toasts. For now show placeholder text
preferrably the toast will slide in from the left over the line being entered
if not show all  toasts at the top of the tiles
Request any sheet to be edited
