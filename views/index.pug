    h2 The Chronicles of Dave Norris and Dean Spiby
    p
      | Dave and Dean are the sort of lifelong friends who look like they were assembled out of spare parts behind a pub at 2:11 a.m.,
      | then immediately tried to pay for crisps with a button and “vibes.”
      | If moral standards were a ladder, they wouldn’t be on the bottom rung.
      | They’d be underneath the ladder, digging a little basement, arguing about whose turn it is to hold the torch, and somehow still getting it wrong.

    p
      | Dave is the human equivalent of a pocket full of warm coins: technically useful, faintly upsetting, and always making that clink sound of poor decisions in motion.
      | He has the energy of a man who has said, “It’ll be fine,” moments before something became absolutely not fine.
      | He doesn’t cut corners so much as remove them entirely and insist the shape is “more aerodynamic” now.
      | He’s the kind of friend who shows up to help you move and brings exactly one glove.
      | Not a pair. One glove. He calls it “efficiency.”

    p
      | Dean, meanwhile, is what happens when you give a raccoon a driver’s license and a strong opinion about Bluetooth speakers.
      | Dean doesn’t enter a room. He announces himself to it, spiritually and acoustically.
      | He laughs like he’s trying to teach hyenas how to commit to the bit.
      | If you told him “don’t touch that,” he wouldn’t just touch it.
      | He’d give it a nickname, put it in his pocket, and later insist it “followed him home.”
      | Dean has never met a boundary he couldn’t interpret as a suggestion.

    p
      | Together, they form a two-man disaster franchise.
      | They are the before-and-after photos of “seemed like a good idea at the time.”
      | They’re the reason warning labels exist.
      | You can’t leave them alone with a reasonable plan because within minutes it becomes an “experiment,” then an “incident,”
      | then a story that starts with, “Right, so… nobody’s hurt, but…”

    p
      | They communicate mostly in half-sentences and suspicious silence.

    ul.dialogue
      li
        strong Dave:
        |  “Hypothetically…”
      li
        strong Dean:
        |  “Say less.”
      li
        strong Reality:
        |  immediately files a complaint

    p
      | Their loyalty is undeniable, though.
      | If you called either of them at 3 a.m., they’d answer on the second ring.
      | Not to help, necessarily, but to be present and provide emotional support in the form of bad advice and a snack they found “in the car.”
      | They’d both show up, too: Dave with a torch that’s already dimming, Dean with a plastic bag containing something that clinks and definitely shouldn’t.

    p
      | And it’s not that they’re evil. That would require ambition and follow-through.
      | No, Dave and Dean are more like chaos with friendship bracelets.
      | Two gremlins in adult coats, permanently one step away from becoming a local legend for all the wrong reasons.
      | They’re playfully awful in the way a shopping trolley with one bad wheel is awful:
      | it’s not trying to ruin your day, but it’s deeply committed to the craft.

    p
      | Still, credit where it’s due: they’ve stayed friends for life,
      | which is impressive considering they treat common sense like it’s an optional DLC they refuse to download.
      | They bicker constantly, but it’s the affectionate kind,
      | like two stray dogs arguing over the best bin behind the nicest restaurant.

    p
      | If Dave and Dean ever got jobs as guardian angels, the paperwork would be spectacular.

    blockquote
      p
        | “Subject survived.”
      p
        | “How?”
      p
        | “Dean distracted the danger by starting an argument with it.”
      p
        | “And Dave?”
      p
        | “Dave tried to help. We don’t discuss that part.”

    p
      | So yes, Dave and Dean are the lowest forms of depravity in the very specific sense
      | that they will absolutely eat the last slice, deny it to your face,
      | and then help you look for it with sincere concern and a mouth full of evidence.
      | But they’re your depraved little goblins, and somehow, inexplicably,
      | the world is funnier (and slightly less structurally sound) with them in it. 🧃🧯
